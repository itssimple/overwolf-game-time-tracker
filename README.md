# Game Time Tracker - an Overwolf application
Yet another time tracking app for Overwolf!

.. no but seriously, we'll try and track all time you spend in games and give you some sweet stats for it. :)

## Planned features
- Track each session of each game
- Give you stats on what game you play the most
- Keep track of APM/KPM for each session
- Be able to go back and compare sessions with each other
- Keep track of what games you have streamed (only if I detect it properly)
- Graphs, everyone loves graphs.. right? ^^
- Don't know what to play? Ask the application and it'll suggest a game that you usually play around the given time and day (will only be able to suggest from the games detected ^^;)
